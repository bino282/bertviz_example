It's not about anyone's personal views, its illegal here. You can't blame someone who isn't ready to tolerate it that you break the law. You have to take the blame on yourself for breaking or trying to break the law in the first place. Just cos its legal where you came from doesn't make it acceptable behavior here.

I have decided that I am going to buy the PS3 but I am going to return to the UK in the near future and I was wondering if anyone could tell me whether it would work with UK games/tvs/power supply etc? Also, I'm thinking of buying it at Virgin in Villagio... Any other good places to buy?   Any help greatly appreciated. 	ok many thanks!
